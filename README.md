## Welcome to the Pythonically packaged version of Avianz!  
This fork lets you interact directly with Avianz via API-like calls to make your life easier, or maybe harder. 

## Launch avianz with a single keyword from the terminal (requires package install)
```
cd avianz
pip install -e .
avianz
```

Features: 
* review and listen to wav files, 
* segment and annotate recordings, 
* train wavelet filters to recognise species, 
* import custom filters and batch process files,
* review annotations and export as csv or JSON, 

For more information, see http://www.avianz.net

# GUI Installation

## Windows
Windows binaries are available at http://www.avianz.net.
To install from source, follow the Linux instructions.

- Remember to include a C compiler such as VS Build Tools, and make sure to check "Desktop development with C++"

(PS)
```
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools
``

OR POSSIBLY:
```winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools --override "--quiet --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools"
```

(then restart PC)

## macOS
An installer script is available at http://www.avianz.net.
To install from source, follow the Linux instructions.

## Linux
No binaries are available. Install from the source as follows:
1. Download the source .zip of the latest release.
2. Extract (`unzip v2.0.zip`) and navigate to the extracted directory.
3. Ensure Python (3.6 or higher), pip and git are available on your system. On Ubuntu, these can be installed by running:  
```
sudo apt-get install python3.6
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo apt-get install git
```
4. Install the required packages by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user` at the command line. (On Ubuntu and some other systems, `python` and `pip` refer to the Python 2 versions. If you are sure these refer to version 3 of the language, use `python` and `pip` in steps 4-6.)  
5. Build the Cython extensions by running `cd ext; python3 setup.py build_ext -i; cd..`  
6. Done! Launch the software with `python3 AviaNZ.py`
